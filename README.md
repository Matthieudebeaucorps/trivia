# Trivial Pursuit 101

Based of the datasets available here:

url: [https://github.com/uberspot/OpenTriviaQA](https://github.com/uberspot/OpenTriviaQA)

## Why?

Created this repository so that it would run a queston generating interface for quiz nights. The idea is to create a full 4 person game that tracks points and correct answers just as the game Trivial Pursuit does but with 5 medals to obtain (vs. 6 triangles in the original game). I have been wanting to make this game as flexible as possible so all question possibilities on the board will be of 2 categories (since I kept 10 categories in total) and the winner will be the first one to reach 5. 

## What?

In the repo you will have different folders/scripts so let me detail what they entail:

#### Jupyter Notebook:
A full script that runs the quesrtions directly onthe interface but does not allow for a point counting system yet

#### App.py: 
Script for the game

#### HTML files:
All the web files required for the different outcomes of the app.py

#### txt. files:
database for the questions, located in categories 

#### csv files:
Translated from .txt files (need to be updated as they don't support true or false)
